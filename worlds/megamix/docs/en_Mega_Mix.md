- Navigate to your archipelago installation (default C:\ProgramData\Archipelago).
- Navigate to \lib\worlds under your archipelago base folder.
- Move megamix.apworld into this folder.

### Generating a game

- Download or generate the megamix YAML file
- Edit the file to have your desired settings.
- Navigate to your archipelago installation (default C:\ProgramData\Archipelago).
- Navigate to \players under your archipelago base folder.
- Move the yaml into this folder.
- Navigate back to your archipelago base folder and run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe
- Your generated game will be in the \output folder under the archipelago base folder.

### Joining a multiworld:

- Navigate to your archipelago base folder (default C:\ProgramData\Archipelago).
- Run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe and click "Mega Mix Client".
- On your first launch, the client should ask you to select your Diva archipelago mod install folder on steam (this can be changed later via the host.yaml file in your Archipelago base folder).
- Connect to the room via the room URL.
- Launch Mega Mix after connecting
- If your song list in game has changed to the starting songs from archipelago, you're ready to go!

## Troubleshooting

- Whenever you get sent a song, to have it show up in the song list you must restart the game, it's not a bug if a song doesn't appear until after a restart. However if a song still doesn't appear after a restart please report it in the discord.
- Make sure the client is connected when you beat a song or it won't count the location as checked until you do it again while connected.
- Please make sure you're using the latest version of either Diva Mod Loader, or Diva Mod Manager
- This mod is incompatible currently with SongLimitPatch! Please turn it off while using the mod!
